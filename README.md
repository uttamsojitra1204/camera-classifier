# camera-classifier
=> A Python application that uses camera input to train a SVM to respond to specific actions.


=> Developed a real-time Camera Classifier System using Python, integrating machine learning and computer vision. Key features include:

- GUI with tkinter: Designed a user-friendly interface to capture and save images for two classes.
- Image Processing with OpenCV: Enabled real-time frame capture, grayscale conversion, and resizing for consistency.
- Model Development: Implemented LinearSVC for binary classification and trained the model on saved images.
- Automation & Prediction: Provided features like auto-prediction mode and reset functionality for seamless usage.
- Hands-on Experience: Gained skills in machine learning, GUI design, and computer vision by building an end-to-end AI solution.
